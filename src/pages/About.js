            <p>My name is Devin Hansen. I come from an extensive background in sales, customer service, creative/performing arts, and most recently software engineering. I have 14 years of experience in sales and customer service via positions including Enterprise Rental Car and Vector Marketing, where I was regularly recognized for being a top 10 performer in generating additional revenue as well as providing quality customer service. I have over 20 years of team experience, including leadership roles, in those positions as well as choral and instrumental ensembles that I have been a part of. Most recently, I have been participating in a rigorous software engineering training offered through Per Scholas, where I have completed dozens of coding projects using computer programming languages/frameworks such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Express, Mongoose, Node, etc.  <br></br><br></br>
            I have a passion for creating things, and I take pride in my work. Contact me! I look forward to seeing what I can do for you and your company!<br></br><br></br>
